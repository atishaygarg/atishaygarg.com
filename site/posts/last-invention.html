<p>Computers are stupid. They are nothing but dumb and dead pieces of metal without any sense or understanding<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. But ask a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: How are you?<br />
Google Assistant: I’m feeling positively tip top. Thanks.<br />
Me: Hope you’re having fun<br />
Google Assistant: It’s always fun to chat.<br />
Me: What else makes you happy?<br />
Google Assistant: Knowing that Tasmanian devils are born as small as a grain of rice makes me happy. So does talking to you.<br />

<p>They are capable to impress upon a sense of life with electric current flowing like blood in their veins.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> But are they alive?</p>
<h3 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h3>
<p>The journey of computers as we know them today truly began when in 1936, Alan Turing, the mathematician who would break the German Enigma Code to win UK the WWII<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, presented a notion of universal computer now known as the Turing Machine. With just 5 instructions, Read, Write, Move Left, Move Right and Halt, a Turing machine can compute anything that is computable. A system which is capable of these 5 operations, is called Turing Complete. All computers to this day, are based on the same principle.</p>
<p>The meaning of information and understanding data, the oil of 21st century, was pioneered by Claude Shannon in early 1940s. It launched one of the three greatest revolutions of modern times<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Shannon’s mathematical constructs could break down an object of interest into long sequences of 0 and 1, later known as bits. They are the simplest form of information. A moment in time (pictures, visual recordings) or the elements of life (DNA) can be captured, stored, and manipulated in bits.</p>
<h3 id="the-frontier">The Frontier</h3>
<p>We have invaded the domain of Gods. We have technology to make the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Weather_Modification_Office?oldformat=true">weather behave on our whims</a>. We grow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/13/scientists-use-stem-cells-from-frogs-to-build-first-living-robots">biological robots today</a>, ride in <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Self-driving_car">autonomous vehicles</a>, conducting trials for <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/">inter-planetary spaceships</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07689-5">teleport</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0727-x">information</a>. run <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/quantum-computing/">quantum computers</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex">mine</a> <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hayabusa2">asteroids</a>, create <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evyjbw/scientists-built-a-tiny-version-of-the-sun-in-wisconsin">stars in labs</a>.</p>
<p>Is there no limit to the technological advancement? And if there is, how close are we to it and can we reach it? At what point does the technological possibilities go beyond our capacity to comprehend it? And because computers only do as we program them to, then are we restricting the computers? What happens when computers program themselves? What can they achieve?</p>
<p>We may have some idea.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-era">A New Era</h3>
<p>Machine learning is the science of making computers learn without explicitly programming them. Taking an instance of handwritten digit recognition, you would not specify the patterns of number 5. You would rather provide examples of 5 and allow the program to self-learn any relevant pattern to detect number 5. The set of digits (training data), and the procedure (training algorithm) works together using trial and error. First, it tries to make a guess and checks whether that is correct. Based on the answer, the system adjusts itself. This process repeating thousands of times with small correction in every loop, ultimately makes the system powerful enough to decide for any given image, whether that is a 5 or not.</p>
<p>This ability to apply the system once trained to any data and achieve reasonable level of accuracy is called generalisation, which is the primary goal of machine learning systems. The described method is called Supervised Learning.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Machine learning was first described in the late 20th century, but its true glory only comes in the last decade. In 2012, Alexnet, a machine learning system<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> achieved such accuracy in image recognition which is never seen before<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. The industry is shaken. It launched a new interest in the field and the development pace rises sharply. In March 2016, DeepMind, a Google owned Artificial Intelligence research organisation pitted their new system named AlphaGo system against the world champion Lee Sedol in the game of Go, a Chinese board game. Considered the most complicated game developed by humanity<sup>[citation needed]</sup> with possibilities exceeding 10<sup>360</sup> possible moves - a number beyond comprehension<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> - it is impossible to exhaust all possibilities by any system by trial and error to evaluate the best move forward. It was considered that computers, with their deterministic, formula based software could never surpass the human intuition which develops through decades of practice. This was computers against humans. To lose meant there is nothing that we could do better than computers. To lose was to forever grant superiority to computers. AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4-1, and the world is taken by storm<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know how to start or what to say today, but I think I would have to express my apologies first. I should have shown a better result, a better outcome, and better content in terms of the game played, and I do apologize for not being able to satisfy a lot of people’s expectations. I kind of felt powerless.” - Lee Sedol, World Champion, Go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things only got worse, or better for computers. To train AlphaGo, its developers had used historic game records played over decades by the best players in the world. The system was fed with guidelines, tactics, approaches. It was, in a way built on human knowledge.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>
<p>AlphaGo Zero, a successor to AlphaGo is fundamentally different. Nothing except the rules of the game were given to the system, and it was allowed to improve by playing itself. It makes random moves first, and based on the outcome of the game, tries to improve itself, assessing which move worked and what didn’t. It repeats the process hundred of thousands of times, repeatedly playing against itself. This is has an exponential effect on the playing skills. As much the system improves, it always has an equal opponent. The following is result that was observed:</p>

Source: DeepMind" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">AlphaGo Zero learning to play Go. Source: DeepMind</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>AlphaGo Zero, learning thoroughly on its own, with no human knowledge, beat AlphaGo 100-0.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note is that the algorithms used for AlphaGo Zero, would work on any game, or for that matter, any task that could be similarly structured. Today almost all games are mastered by computers and the world champions, rather than try to overcome them, learn from them. Studying computer’s moves for months, because it is too advanced for them. AlphaGo Zero in the truest sense, gives us a glimpse of what computers are capable of when not restricted by human knowledge.</p>
<p>It was just the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="the-uncharted">The Uncharted</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenge in modern computing has been developing systems that would understand language. Human communication is vague. Words derive their meaning from the context they are used in. Human interaction consists of gestures, expression and tone at least as much as the actual words used. NLP or the Natural Language Processing is the branch of Machine Learning that studies human-to-computer interactions through natural language. This is one of the most happening field in Machine Learning.</p>
<p>In 2018, OpenAI presented <a href="https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/">GPT</a>, a natural language processor based on neural network, trained over 117 Million parameters. Trained on large textual datasets, including digital book corpus, GPT was capable of processing long text and answer basic questions over the analyzed text.</p>
<p>A year later, in 2019, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> was announced which was trained on 1.5 Billion parameters, 10x larger than the first model of GPT. It’s release was initially delayed for fears of misuse. It was capable of writing reasonable, context sensitive articles, which could flood the media as fake news.</p>
<p>The most powerful natural language processor was released just last year in June 2020, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, the biggest system ever trained, with 175 Billion parameters is a dramatic improvement over its predecessor. It can answer trivial questions, publish blogs, pen poetry, summarise emails, can even code other programs.</p>

<p>“It is a curious fact that the last remaining form of social life in which the people of London are still interested is Twitter. I was struck with this curious fact when I went on one of my periodical holidays to the sea-side, and found the whole place twittering like a starling-cage.”</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from a conversation with GPT-3 impersonating Albert Einstein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manuel: Albert Einstein. Nice to meet you. I’m Manuel Araoz, and I’ve come from the future to meet you. <em>smiles</em><br />
Albert: <em>laughs</em> Oh, really. How is the future?<br />
Manuel: It’s amazing, actually. What year is this?<br />
Albert: It’s 1947. It’s January. This is Princeton, NJ. You are in America.<br />
Manuel: Your name is Albert Einstein, right?<br />
Albert: That’s correct.<br />
Manuel: So, how would you describe your contributions to science so far?<br />
Albert: Well, I’ve already made some pretty important contributions to physics.<br />
Manuel: <em>grabs coffee from table and takes a sip</em> Tell me more.<br />
Albert: Well, first of all, my work with the photoelectric effect and quantum mechanics was very important for the development of quantum physics.<br />
Manuel: What does quantum physics mean? Sorry, I’m no physicist myself.<br />
Albert sits back in his comfortable chair, and after taking a slow sip of tea, explains.<br />
Albert: You see, a hundred years ago, our understanding of the Universe, and how it all works, was still fairly immature. There were many loose ends, which we were starting to try and unravel. For example, things like what the atom is made of, or what light actually is.<br />

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Machines are powerful, and while for them what they produce means nothing, their actions can have serious consequences for us. Just as they’re capable of doing good, they’re equally capable of acting bad, where the difference would be just known to us.</p>

<p>Thinking about values to be hard-coded into such systems is a critical question facing humanity, the most important conversation of our time <span class="citation" data-cites="tegmarkLifeBeingHuman2017">(Tegmark 2017)</span>. Super Intelligence, as defined by Nick Bostrom, is a point when an agent would surpass the brightest and most gifted humans in intelligence at virtually all tasks and domains of life. It would come without any warning. It would be the last thing that humanity would invent.</p>
<p>Just two decades ago, you could not have imagined a piece of metal in your pocket, capable of encapsulating your whole life. We can only but wonder what the next two decades would bring. We’re breaking barriers which till now seemed unbreakable. Technology development is inevitable. It is growing faster than anyone can control. Nobody knows where it is going. These are exciting times. You must be ready.</p>
